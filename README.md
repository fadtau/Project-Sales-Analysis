# Pandas Project : Sales Analysis
This repository is my learning by doing according to *Keith Gally* youtube that discuss about using Pandas in Real Data Science Projects. I did by myself and little help from the videos. I learned new things about :
  - Concatenate multiple `.csv` files
  - Visualize using `matplotlib` with barchart and linechart
  - The use of `lambda function` (lambda x: )
  - `Data Aggregation` using Pandas
